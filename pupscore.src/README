Standard PUPS libraries - Note that this version of the PUPS libraries
are supported by ANSI compilers only

To build/install in production mode
===================================

Type:

installpupsP3.csh cluster tty force default

Programs can be built by typing:
configure cluster <makefile template> followed by make.


To build/install in debug mode
===============================

Type:

installpupsP3.csh cluster tty force default debug

Programs which make use of the PUPS/P3 libraries can then be debugged
by typing:

testconfigure <make template> - to generate debug makefile
followed by make. The resulting binary can then be debugged
using (for example gdb).

To clean source tree
====================

Type:

installpupsP3 clean


To delete production installation
=================================

Type:

uninstallpupsP3.csh
