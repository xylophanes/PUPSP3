Standard PUPS libraries - Note that this version of the PUPS libraries
are supported by ANSI compilers only

To build in production mode
===========================

Type:

build_pups_services.csh cluster tty force default

Programs can be built by typing:
configure cluster <makefile template> followed by make.


To build in debug mode
======================

Type:

build_pups_services.csh cluster tty force default debug

Programs which make use of the PUPS/P3 libraries can then be debugged
by typing:

testconfigure <make template> - to generate debug makefile
followed by make. The resulting binary can then be debugged
using (for example gdb).

There is an example program, test.c and associated makefile template
Make_test.in included in the distribution.
