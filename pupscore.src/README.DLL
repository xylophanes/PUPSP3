To make a dynamic link library containg the functionality in testdll.c

1) compile: gcc -I../include.libs -fPIC -c testdll.c (produces testdll.o)
2) make shared object: somake testdll.so testdll.o
3) use dll functionality of PSRP server (e.g. embryo) to attach it.

Not we have to use -fPIC flag to produce position independent code.
